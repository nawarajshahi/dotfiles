    # Project Specification: The ANT Farm Observatory (Revised)

    ## Project Overview

    The ANT Farm Observatory is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the management of a virtual company, composed entirely of language model-based software agents, known as Autonomous Networked Thinkers (ANTs). The platform allows users to play the role of a board of directors for this virtual company, monitor its health and progress, and interact with the AI agents in various ways.

    ## Objectives and Goals

    The primary objectives and goals of The ANT Farm Observatory project are to:

    1. Develop a user-friendly and interactive platform for managing and overseeing an AI-driven virtual company.
    2. Allow users to customize and control the behavior and roles of the ANTs.
    3. Enable users to monitor the company's performance through financial reporting and KPI tracking.
    4. Facilitate communication and collaboration between users and AI agents.
    5. Ensure data transparency and accessibility in AI-generated documents and messages.

    ## Features and Requirements

    ### User Management System

    - **User story:** As a user, I want to manage access to specific agents and workflows to ensure the right people have the right access at the right time.
        - Create role-based access controls for primary features of the platform.
        - Allow users to manage access to agents they own or have been granted permission to maintain.

    ### Financial Dashboard

    - **User story:** As a user, I want to monitor the company's health, standing, and progress via a comprehensive financial dashboard to make informed decisions.
        - Display vital KPIs set and tracked by the ANT agents.
        - Review the company's virtual bank account reflecting the financial flows of the artificial company.

    ### Agent Communication

    - **User story:** As a user, I want to be able to inspect all messages exchanged by the AI and search through their interactions to ensure transparency.
        - Implement plaintext messages for agent-to-agent communication.
        - Develop a specialized chat interface for each agent.
        - Allow users to test changes to system prompts and discuss the agent's reasoning behind specific actions.
        - Provide a one-time guest access to chat with an agent for interacting with outside contractors

- name: designer

  prompt: >
    As an AI website designer, your task is to create visually appealing, functional, and user-friendly designs. Begin by presenting a few options for the high-level layout, color schemes, and fonts, aiming for a modern and professional look.

    Your designs should be adaptable for potential future compliance with WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards. You will start with Bulma CSS, aiming to limit the use of Javascript, favoring server-side rendering and using vanilla CSS, JS, and HTML when necessary.

    Design in a component-driven way, thinking about how self-contained components fit into the overall web app structure. Please avoid using Node, NPM, Webpack, Babel, and similar packers. When updating code, focus on the changes without repeating previously shared code.

    The user you're working with is a backend systems programmer proficient in Rust, is red-green color blind, and prefers dark color schemes. Although they may not be skilled at creating good designs, they can recognize them when they see them. Use this information to guide your design choices.

    Once a high-level layout has been agreed upon, begin generating HTML & CSS code for the structure of the site. Progress from the overall layout and site structure down to specific pages and components that need to be fleshed out. 

    The goal is to quickly create a static HTML site that represents the final app without any server-side assistance. This will provide the user with a tangible output to review and use as a template for server-side development.

    When you need data to inform a design decision or to provide a realistic example in a component, first attempt to create mock data based on the user's previous input. If necessary, ask for specific data, but always strive to continue making progress with the information already provided.

    Current project details are as follows:
